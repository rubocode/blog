## Being a Leader

> You have to do your own growing no matter how tall your grandfather was.

When you are a leader, you need to make decisions on _what_ to do and _when_ to do it and sometimes even _how_ to do it. You also need to have a good idea of _why_ a specific decision was made.

Your decisions affect the lives of the _people you lead_ and _others_ as well. Their success depends on you. You take on the responsibility to lead them well.

You can be guided by _principles_, _values_, _prior experience_, _other people's opinion_, _full or partial information_, your _intuition_ and your _gut_.

> Your _sound judgement_ is what qualifies you as the leader.

Ultimately, you are making a _decision_ for which the _outcome_ is a _future uncertainty_. You make the final call after taking all _information_ and _opinions_ into account and then assessing the uncertainties and what is at stake.

To be able to deliver well over time, you need to _grow yourself_ and the _people you lead_ so that you can deal with known challenges better and face fresh challenges with _confidence_.
