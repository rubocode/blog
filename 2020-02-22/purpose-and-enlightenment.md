## Purpose and Enlightenment

> In the broadest context, the goal is to seek enlightenment - however you define it.

The _Christian_ tradition encourages you to find _your purpose in life_ and then _live_ it.  The _Buddhist_ tradition encourages you to _seek the truth_ and _pursue enlightenment_.

When you can _actually see the truth_, you are enlightened.  Then, you are in a better position to grasp _your role in life_, in other words, _your purpose_.

You can arrive at what you think is _the truth_, but you need _confirmation_.  You need to be able to _judge_ whether you have arrived.  You're going to need an _internal compass_.

Personal development is the _continuous process_ of _evolving this internal compass_.
