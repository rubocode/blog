## Systems Psychology

Understanding how a system works, wanting to change it, and actually changing it, are _three different things_ altogether.

The _motivations_ for doing the three things are almost completely independent.  Each of them require different talents and skill sets to do them effectively.  Rare is the person who can do all three and succeed.   

## Understanding How a System Works
This requires a person who _likes to understand how things work_ and exercise _analytical skills_.  The task involves understanding _existing theories_ about the system and _what_ it is about the system that _you are interested in_ at the moment.

You need to know _how existing theories compare_.  You need to know their _strengths_ and _inadequacies_. You need to have a _creative mind_ to connect these with the _need at hand_ and even create _new theories_.

## Wanting to Change a System
The first thing you want to decide is _whether_ you want to _change the system_ at all.  _Most of the time you don't_.  Even when you do, you might be coming from _different motivations_.

If you are _adversely affected_ by a system, you will have a _genuine motivation_ to change the system.  This is especially true if you have no choice but to live with the system.  You still have the option of letting the system be.

Sometimes people want to change a system for _the boost it gives to their ego_.  This is a _dangerous motivation_ as you may neither understand the system nor have the ability to successfully change it.

In the ideal scenario, you want to change a system to _fix a problem_, _improve efficiency_, or _optimize resource management_, essentially, to _make things better_.

For fruitful results, you need to really understand _the purpose of the system_ and _the purpose of the desired change_.

## Actually Changing a System
The _successful changing_ of a system requires _visionary leadership_.  First, you need to _understand the system adequately_.  Second, you need to _understand the desired change_ and the _purpose of that change_.  Third, you need the ability to _learn fast and adapt_.

When you _actually_ do it, you need a _holistic view_ and must be _willing to learn and adapt_ as it may turn out that all the old and new _theories are wrong_ for a _given situation_.

What will help you all the way are your understanding of _the system_, _the purpose of the desired change_ and _your genuine desire_ to change the system _for the better_.
