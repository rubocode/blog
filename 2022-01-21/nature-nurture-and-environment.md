## Nature, Nurture and Environment

> Life is a delicate maneuver of selection, rejection, review and change.

Nature is who you are — your strengths, abilities and preferences.  You will have a unique combination of these.

Nurture is what the people around you do with this unique combination.  Here, other human beings guide your learning in a positive or negative way shaping you in various different aspects.  Nurture creates a foundation for the way you approach your future challenges.  It develops your character.

Environment is where you find yourself in any given moment.  You can also think of it as one or more scenarios you are facing.  Your initial nurture happens in an environment usually made up of your family, neighborhood and school.

Your learning in the progression of environments you navigate prepares you for greater challenges. It enhances your character and the skill with which you navigate a new or more complex environment.

If your nurture is congruent with your nature, you tap into the full potential of your capacity.

If you are aware of the nature of the environment that is best for you — and you can find it or create it — you have an advantage.

But, you don't always get to choose your environment.
