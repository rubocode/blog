## Time, Money and Effort

> If money is your hope for independence, you will never have it.  The only real security that a man will have in this world is a reserve of knowledge, experience, and ability.  
> **Henry Ford**

***Time*** is a funny beast.  It simply ticks away and you get to choose your activity within it.

***Money*** is a funny beast.  You can choose to spend money in a way that you will get more money to spend later.

***Effort*** is a funny beast.  You get to choose your level of commitment to your goals small or large.

These are resources at your disposal.

Choose wisely.
