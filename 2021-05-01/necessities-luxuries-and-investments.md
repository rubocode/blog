## Necessities, Luxuries and Investments

> Civilization is the limitless multiplication of unnecessary necessities.  
> **Mark Twain**

When allocating time, money or effort into something, you need to make wise choices to conserve and optimize your resources.

A ***necessity*** is what is essential at this moment. You know what is needed and you need to plan to have it at your disposal.

A ***luxury*** is what is not essential at the moment but would be nice to have. But you can do without it without regret.

An ***investment*** is what you spend now so that you can accommodate the necessities and the luxuries of the future in a way that is faster, better and cheaper.

You get a choice to consider something a necessity, a luxury or an investment each time you spend time, money or effort.

Choose wisely.
