## Faith, Family and Vocation

It helps to have a simple way to organize your life's priorities.

This is one of the best I have come across.

***Faith*** helps you be in the right posture.

***Family*** is a lifelong commitment and your primary responsibility.

***Vocation*** is what you do in collaboration with others in service to others.

You are free to decide what you do and how you do it.

It helps to keep your priorities straight.
