## Ideal Culture

> Ask and it shall be given you;
> seek, and ye shall find;
> knock, and it shall be opened unto you:    
> ***Matthew 7:7 KJV***

Everyone wants to be better off than they are now.  What they don't know is what that better future looks like and feels like and how that affects other people.  ***Can we all have what we want?***

It is clear that we can't simply have all the physical and the material that we want.  We will be in ***competition*** with other people.  However, we do have control over what we think we want.  Herein lies the key to our ***liberation***.

The ideal culture should manage the competition for the physical and the material based on well conceived criteria of ***fairness*** and ***justice***.  We call such a culture, a ***meritocracy***.

There are a multitude of conceptual frameworks, philosophies, religious and spiritual traditions that aim to provide guidance.  These are contained in two broad categories, ***worldly*** and ***spiritual***.

The worldly guidance is contained in the ***legal*** and the ***financial*** frameworks.  This is what controls the physical and the material.  The spiritual helps you gain the necessary discipline to participate in the worldly and find the desired ***liberation***.

The ideal culture needs to ***accommodate*** and ***facilitate*** the people who are at different points in their ***journey***.
