## Traits, Talents and Skills

Traits are _nature_. The general disposition of a person, temperament, whether they prefer tea or coffee, the way people are.  Traits are not about _utility_, they are about _nature_.

Talents are also _nature_, but they are _abilities_.  They have _utility_.  Whether a person can run fast, can speak clearly, or sing well.

A _skill_ is _what is displayed_ or _demonstrated_.  A person who can run fast displays the skill of running fast.  A person who can't run so fast can _practice_ hard and become able to run fast and show similar skill.  _Running fast is the skill_.  The reason for the _ability_ to display the skill can be _nature_, _nurture_ or a _combination of the two_.

You don't get to choose your _traits_ and _talents_.  But you get to choose your _skills_.

_Strengths_ and _weaknesses_ are construed as _degrees of expression of skill_.
