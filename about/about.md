# About

I am a Strategy Consultant residing in Sri Lanka.  I graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, USA as a Computer Engineer with a minor concentration in Philosophy in 1996.

It turned out that writing helps me think clearly and I thought that I share some of that with the rest of the world.  I have organized my thoughts around the categories of Philosophy, Psychology, Strategy and Systems.  My hope is that you will find some of my scribblings useful to you in your own journey.


This is me at at the back of Jacobus Lounge at Stevens Institute of Technology during my undergraduate years. You can see the Empire State Building in the background.

I wish you good luck!
