## Good, Bad, Right and Wrong

> Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.  
> **Romans 12:21**

_Good_ and _bad_ are both _subjective_. What is good for you can be bad for me. What is bad for you can be good for me. _Right_ and _wrong_ are _objective_. What is the right thing to do in a given situation? Answering that requires _education_, _knowledge_, _morality_ and _thought_. This is the case because what is right must take _everyone_ and _everything_ into account. Good and bad are _selfish_. Right and wrong are _holistic_.

It is _good_ to eat ice cream everyday. You feel good. You are supporting the dairy industry and that means jobs for people. But it is not good for you in the long run because you would get diabetes much earlier. If you have family responsibilities, it is also wrong to do it because your early death will affect their lives.

Sometimes people do the _right thing_ even when it is _bad_ for them personally. We call such an act a _noble_ act. But more often people do the _wrong thing_ that is _good_ for them.

People who do the _wrong thing_ have a _subjective_, in other words _selfish_, perspective and a _short term_ focus.

To do the _right thing_ you have to be _objective_ and think of the _long term_.
