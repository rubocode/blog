## Content, Technology and Skill

Let's consider the writing craft.  What you write is the _content_, i.e., the _product_, the _result_, the _outcome_.

_Language_ is a technology and so is making _paper_ and the _pen_ with which you are writing.  If you are on a _typewriter_ that is also technology.  If you are using a _computer_, the _hardware_ and _software_ are also technology.

_Skill_ is the _human ability_ you use in creating _both_ the _content_ and the _technology_.

You increase _capacity_ and _potential_ by developing _human ability_.
