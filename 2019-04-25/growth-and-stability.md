## Growth and Stability

> Start from wherever you are and with whatever you've got.

When you're not sure where you're going, you are _seeking_ and you need growth.  When you've found where you're going, your _direction_ has become stable.

You then grow to become stable in your _confidence_ that you can get there.

While on your journey, you grow to tackle the _challenges_ you face so that you're on a stable _trajectory_.

Once you've arrived at where you were going, you like to _enjoy_ the stability that you have achieved.

Then you grow to show others the _path_ to stability.

The whole point of _growth_ is _stability_.
