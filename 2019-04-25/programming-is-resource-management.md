## Programming is Resource Management

> Premature optimization is the root of all evil.  
> **Donald Knuth**

We manage four critical fundamental resources when we program computers.

## Time
We like to do things _as fast as possible_.  Given that hardware operations take fixed time, the way to increase speed is to come up with _algorithms_ that use the least number of operations.

## Space
We have _random access memory_, _internal permanent storage_ and _external permanent storage_.  We can employ strategies that allow us to optimize computing speed via efficient storage and retrieval.

## Labor
The labor inside a computer is represented by the _processors_.  Better labor management includes _asking less of each processor_ and employing strategies for _optimal processor collaboration_.

## Knowledge
We manage the knowledge that we store in our computers.  We decide _what to keep_ and _how to organize_ it.  The algorithms we use are themselves knowledge.

We need to manage the same resources at a much _higher level_ and at _greater sophistication_ in real life.
