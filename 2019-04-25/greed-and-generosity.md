## Greed and Generosity

> Generosity brings happiness at every stage of its expression.
	We experience joy in forming the intention to be generous. We experience joy in the actual act of giving something. And we experience joy in remembering the fact that we have given.  
> **Buddha**

Greed and generosity are attitudes toward life which provide very different operating principles.

Greed says that you're in this game for yourself and that everyone else is out to get you and that you must defend and protect your resources.

Generosity says that you got this far because of contributions that other human beings have made available to you and that you should do the same and make it easier for others to navigate life.

Operating with greed in a culture of generosity is easier than _operating with generosity in a culture of greed_.

Life is not about doing the easy thing, but about doing the right thing.
