## Crisis and Management

> Organizational effectiveness does not lie in that narrow minded concept called rationality. It lies in the blend of clearheaded logic and powerful intuition.  
> Henry Mintzberg

A crisis is something that is an exceptional circumstance, something out of the ordinary that interrupts your regular pattern.  You will need to shift your priorities and attend to the emergency or else it will continue to disrupt your life.

Managing a crisis requires leadership starting with self, family and institutional leadership and all the way up to national and global leadership.

> * identify the causes of the crisis
> * find ways to eliminate the causes
> * find ways mitigate the effects

Crisis management requires alignment and prioritization.  If it is a personal crisis you need to align with the reality of the situation and look for remedies.  If it is a national or global crisis, the leader needs to align the people of that whole community to work towards a common goal.

In dealing with a crisis, a leader of a community must marshal the collective expertise of the population and the collective physical resources available.

Alignment is very important in mobilizing people to solve the issue.

This is achieved with a mission statement that clearly identifies causes, effects and goals together with elimination and mitigation strategies. It can then be used by each individual in the community to guide their actions.

The mission statement must be centrally managed and be available to all in the community.  There must be a mechanism to notify exceptions and challenges to the top to make course corrections as needed.
