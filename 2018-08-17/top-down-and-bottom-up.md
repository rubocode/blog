## Top Down and Bottom Up

Top down is a big picture approach. You know from the beginning what you want or where you’re going. You pick up _specific_ skills and knowledge only as necessary since you are focused and you know where you’re going. You say _yes_ to things that help you where you’re going and say _no_ to things that will not help. This is a _goal-oriented_ approach.

Bottom up is to take stock of the present and adopt an exploratory approach. You don’t know the ultimate destination, but you’re in search of it. You have to figure out what you really want. You have to make course corrections as you go. You acquire more _general-purpose_ skills and knowledge along the way. This is a _process-oriented_ approach.

You may need to use _one_ or _both_ of these approaches in a given situation.
